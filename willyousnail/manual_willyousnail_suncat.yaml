# Expectations before starting the manual:
# You have beaten the game, unlocked all levels, and know how to collect all
#springs and exploration points. The logic expects that you'll be able to
#collect some checks in multiple ways, so be prepared to figure out some work-
#-arounds using Intentional Bug and water pump
# 
# Starting state:
# Either a completed game, or a new file + enable Exploration mode in Settings->
#->Gameplay->Assist Features.
#
# Rules of the manual:
# All levels are closed behind doors. All those doors and most vanilla doors are
#locked with Locks, which you have to unlock using Keys (including the door in
#the Level Select area). You start with a single Key, which also marks which
#level/area you are starting from. Your game abilities are now limited by the
#knowledge of a new player - you can't use the Intentional Bug before you read
#about it in the Spring that explains it! Also, all springs are intangible and
#have no information you can read from them, and you can't even use them as
#trampolines and guns don't shoot unless you receive corresponding AP item, and
#all exploration points are gone from the world. But at least you can now collect
#AP items from every Lock, Exploration point, Spring location, and Gun location.
# In terms of fishing, you either have to shoot fish with the gun, or you have to
#win the race, or if you can do neither you just have to touch the fish location.
#This gives you AP items, and all the fish are turned into AP items too.
# Optional limitation: Play from a new file+Exploration mode, and set Automatic
#Difficulity to ON. Don't turn it off and don't change the difficulty until you 
#receive Spring 50.
#
# Goal: Collect some combination of all 56 Springs all 46 exploration points,
#and all 49 'fish', based on the goal you've chose in settings
